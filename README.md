# Restaurant-Order-Analysis 

## The Context:

The Taste of the World Café, a restaurant with a varied menu, introduced a new set of offerings. As a data analyst, the task was to delve into customer data to assess the reception of the new items. The goal was to identify successful and underperforming menu items, understand customer preferences and extract actionable insights to inform business decisions. This project was aimed to leverage SQL queries to analyze the ‘menu_items’ and ‘order_details’ tables, providing valuable insights into customer behavior and menu performance.

## Objectives:

•	Explore the menu_items table to get an idea of what’s on the new menu

•	Explore the order_details table to get an idea of the data that’s been collected

•	Use both the tables to understand how customers are reacting to the new menu

## Insights:

•	The data available for this analysis consisted of order data from January through March 2023

•	Over a three –month period, The Café processed 5370 orders

•	Featuring American, Asian, Mexican and Italian cuisines, The Taste of the World Café offers a wide array of options to its customers. Despite a richer selection of Mexican and Italian dishes, the most popular choices belong to the American and Asian categories

•	The top 5 ordered items are the hamburgers, edamame, Korean beef bowl, cheese burger and French fries. This suggests that customers tend to favor classic comfort food and Asian inspired dishes

•	Items like steak tacos, cheese lasagna, pot stickers and chicken tacos are among the least ordered. This could indicate either lack of popularity for specific dishes or potential areas for improvement in their presentation or taste

•	Menu items range in price from $5 to $19.95, accommodating various budget preferences

•	Edamame is the least expensive and shrimp scampi is the most expensive menu item

•	Some Mexican items are not doing well. Hamburgers are very popular among the customers and should be kept on the menu

•	Just from the top 5 orders, it can be concluded that these highest spend orders tend to be spending a lot on Italian food. So , these expensive Italian dishes should be kept on the menu because the people seem to be ordering them a lot, especially the highest spend customers
